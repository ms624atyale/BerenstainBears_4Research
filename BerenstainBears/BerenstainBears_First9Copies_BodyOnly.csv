"Down a sunny dirt road, over a log bridge, up a grassy hill, deep in Bear Country, lived a family of bears—Papa Bear, Mama Bear and Small Bear. They lived in a large tree which Papa Bear had hollowed out and made into a house. It was a very fine house. This is what it looked like inside. It was fun growing up in Bear Country...helping Papa get honey from the old bee tree...helping Mama bring the vegetables in from the garden. There were all sorts of interesting things for a small bear to do and see in Bear-Country. Small Bear felt good growing up in a tree...in his own room...in the snug little bed that Papa Bear had made for him when he was a baby. But one morning, it did not feel so good. Small Bear woke up with pains in his knees and aches in his legs. “Small Bear, you have outgrown your little bed,” said Papa Bear, as he hitched up his overalls and buttoned his shoulder straps. “Today, we shall go out into the woods and make you a bigger one!” With that, he ate his breakfast of piping-hot porridge...washed it down with a gulp of honey from the family pot...took up his ax and was out the door. “But, Papa,” called Small Bear, following after him. “What will happen to my little bed?” “Don’t worry about that, Small Bear,” said Mama Bear as she closed the door after him. She smiled and patted her front, which had lately grown very big and round. “You’ve outgrown that snug little bed just in time!” He tested the ax to see if it was sharp, then headed off into the woods. “What will happen to my little bed?” Small Bear asked again as he caught up with Papa Bear in the woods. Papa had chopped down a tree and was splitting it into boards. “We will have a new baby soon who will need that little bed,” said papa Bear as he whacked off another board. “A ne baby?” asked Small Bear. (He hadn’t noticed that Mama Bear had grown very round lately, although he had noticed it was harder and harder to sit on her lap.) “And it’s coming soon?” “Yes, very soon!” said Papa Bear. With a final whack he split off the last board, which gave him enough wood to make a bigger bed for Small Bear. They made the bed a good size and took the rest of the day to chip and shave it smooth and neat. Then they carried it back to the tree and up to Small Bear’s room. When they got there, Small Bear noticed right away that his old bed wasn’t there any more. “My little bed!” said Small Bear. “It’s already gone!” “You outgrew it just in time,” called Mama Bear from the next room. “Come and see.” It was true! There was his snug little bed with a new little baby in it. Small Bear had outgrown his snug little bed just in time for his new baby sister. And now he was a big brother! She was very little but very lively. As Small Bear learned over for a closer look, she popped him on the nose with a tiny fist. “Hmm,” said Small Bear. “She has a pretty good punch for a little baby.” That night he stretched out proudly in his bigger bed. “Aah!” he said. “Being a big brother is going to be fun.” The next morning he woke up feeling fine, with no pains in his knees or aches in his legs. His nose was a little tender, though."
"The Bear family didn’t always live in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in Bear Country. Years ago, when Brother Bear was an only cub, they lived in a hillside cave halfway up Great Bear Mountain at the far edge of Bear Country. It was a comfortable cave, cool in summer and cozy in winter. And while it wasn’t perfect—it tended to be dark and it dripped and trickled a bit—it was home, and the Bear family was quite happy there. Happy and busy. Mama Bear kept busy managing things and tending the vegetable patch. Papa Bear had plenty to do with his wood cutting and furniture making. And Brother Bear kept busy climbing, collecting rocks, and playing with his friends. But living on the mountainside wasn’t perfect—it wasn’t easy growing vegetables in the thin, rocky soil, and the trees Papa needed were getting fewer and farther between. But the sun was bright, the air was clear and sparkling, and the view was magnificent! Yes, the Bear family was happy and content living in their hillside cave halfway up Great Bear Mountain at the far edge of Bear Country....Until one day, Papa Bear said, “My dears, the time has come to move.” “Move!?” cried Brother Bear. “That’s right,” said Papa. “The trees are getting few and far between on the mountainside.” “Yes,” said Mama, “and it’s not easy raising enough vegetables for a growing family in this thin, rocky soil.” “Where are we going to move to?” Brother asked. “To the valley,” said Papa as he began putting lamps and things into a box. “The valley?” said Brother. The valley down there was nice to look at, but he wasn’t so sure he wanted to live there. It was so far away. “What about my toys”? asked Brother. “We’ll take them along, of course. Put them in there,” said Papa, handing him a box. “And what about my books?” “We’ll take them along, too,” said Papa, handing him another box. “And what about my friends?” asked Brother. “We can’t put them in a box and take them along!” “That’s true,” said Mama, lifting Brother onto her lap. “You’ll be leaving your friends behind. Papa and I will, too. That’s what happens when you move. But you can keep in touch with them. You can write, even visit, perhaps. And besides, you can make lots of new friends.” “When are we going to move?” Brother wanted to know. “Tomorrow, bright and early,” Mama told him. “The moving bears will be here first thing in the morning. That night, as Brother bedded down in in his corner of the cave, he wondered what it would be like to leave his old neighborhood and his old friends. He wondered what it would be like to move into a new neighborhood, making new friends. And then he began to wonder if he would ever fall asleep. And just when it began to seem that he never would, he did. The next morning, the moving bears came with their big truck and began moving the Bear family’s things out of the cave. “Everything goes!” said Papa. And everything did. The moving bears were very fast, but very careful. Before long, the cave was empty. Then, after a fond farewell look at their old home, the Bear family said good-bye to their friends and neighbors, got into their car, and headed down the mountain. The big moving truck followed. Down, down the mountainside they went. After a few tight spots and a few wrong turns, they were in the rich green forest of the valley. “Look at that forest!” said Papa. “Now I shall have plenty of wood to cut.” They passed farms with fine fields. “And look at that rich brown soil! What a vegetable garden I’ll have!” said Mama. Brother was on the lookout for friends and playmates. But all he saw were a frog and some butterflies. And they didn’t look very friendly. “Get ready!” said Papa, as they turned onto a sunny dirt road. “Just around this bend is our new home!” “But, it's a tree!” said Brother. “A tree house! said Papa. “A fine tree house—with a downstairs, and an upstairs, and an attic...and even a room of your own!” It was, indeed, a fine house—a whole house hollowed out of a great oak. It did need work—the paint was old, there were some broken steps, and some of the bark was loose—but Mama and Papa had great plans for fixing it up. As the movers took the Bears’ things into their new home, the Bears imagined what it would look like when it was all fixed. It was going to be very beautiful. They were so busy imagining, that they didn’t notice they had company. Their new neighbors had come with gifts of welcome. There were rabbits with carrot stew, bird and squirrel families with seeds and nuts, and a number of bear families with honeycombs, wild berries—and lots of cubs to make friends with. The Bear family felt very welcome in their new neighborhood. That night they went to bed very tired, but very happy. And when they got their tree hose all fixed up, it was just about perfect. "
"“Brother Bear,” said Sister impatiently, “are you going to take all day to pick your books?” Sister and Brother Bear at the Bear Country Library. Sister had already chosen her books and was waiting at the check-out desk. “Hold your horses,” said Brother. “I am looking for a good mystery.” Sister Bear usually took out storybooks and books about nature—and sometimes books of poems. Brother liked those, too, but lately he’d become interested in mysteries—especially spooky ones. “Hey, this one looks good,” he said finally. “Okay, let’s check out.” “Hmmm,” said Sister, looking at the cover. It was called The Case of the Crying Cave. “It looks scary to me!” “Say! This is really good!” said Brother later that evening when the Bear family had settled down for some reading. “Would you like me to read it to you?” he asked Sister. Sister was looking at a storybook about three kittens who were arguing about which was the prettiest—and it was a little boring. “Or are you scared?” teased Brother. “Of course not,” said Sister. She left her book on the floor and climbed onto the bench to sit beside him. The mystery began quietly. It told about some bear scouts who were on an overnight camp-out. When the scouts discovered a dark, secret cave, Brother’s mystery began to get a little exciting. And when the cave began to cry and wail, it was anything but quiet! “’Who-o-o-o-o! cried the deep, dark mysterious cave,’” read Brother with a lot of expression. “’Who-o-o-o-o!’” “Stop!” said Sister, putting her fingers in her ears. “That’s enough!” And she went back to her storybook. “Scaredy bear! Scaredy bear!” teased Brother. “And that’s quite enough of that,” added Papa Bear, looking up from his paper. At the cubs’ bedtime Papa and Mama said good night, turned off the light, and left the cubs in the usual sleepy darkness. Outside the tree house the bright, busy sounds of day had given way to the soft, soothing sounds of night—the quiet conversation of frogs and toads, the soft cry of the owl, the sigh of the night wind. And if you listened very hard, you could almost hear the softest sound of all—the sound of lightning bugs switching their lights on and off, on and off. But inside the tree house Sister Bear wasn’t even beginning to fall asleep. That night the dark didn’t seem the least bit quiet and sleepy. In fact, it seemed like the spooky darkness of a scary cave. And the friendly old chest of drawers and funny clothes tree that Papa had made didn’t seem so friendly and funny. They seemed more like cave creatures. So when brother decided to tease her a little more by making a wailing noise—a really spooky wailing noise—it gave her quite a scare. “Mama! Papa!” she cried. “Hurry! Come quick!” And come quickly they did. Papa rushed into the dark room and tripped over the clothes tree. Mama rushed in after Papa and tripped over him. In the commotion Sister fell out of bed and landed on both of them. Then Brother, who had started it all with his spooky wail, turned on the light. What a mess! Sister, still scared, was holding on to Papa. Papa was holding on to the toe he had stubbed. And Mama was looking for the night cap she had lost in the confusion. All three of them were pretty annoyed with Brother Bear. It turned out to be a very long night in the Bear’s tree house. Papa and Mama tried to explain that there was nothing to be afraid of in the dark (except maybe running into a clothes tree and stubbing your toe)—but it didn’t do any good. Sister absolutely refused to go to sleep with the light off. And Brother positively insisted that he couldn’t fall asleep with the light on. The next morning the Bear family was very sleepy-eyed.  “Boy,” said Brother, yawning, “I sure don’t want to go through another night like that!” “Neither do I,” said Papa. “And I think I have an idea that might help.” He took Sister’s hand. “Come with me,” he said. “Where are we going?” she wanted to know. “Up to the attic.” “The attic? But it’s dark in the attic—even in the daytime.” “I know,” said Papa. “But there’s something I want to show you. Anyway, there’s nothing so special about the dark. It’s just part of nature, like the light. It’s your imagination that makes the dark seem spooky sometimes.” “What’s imagination?” asked Sister. “Imagination is what makes us think that chests of drawers and clothes trees are cave creatures.” “I wish I didn’t have one,” said Sister. “Don’t say that,” said Papa. “A lively imagination is one of the best things a cub can have. It’s imagination that lets us paint pictures, make up poems, invent inventions! The trick is to take charge of your imagination—and not let it take charge of you.” When they got to the attic, Papa began to rummage through boxes, looking for something. Sister tried to follow Papa’s advice and not let her imagination take charge. And it worked—a spooky shape turned out to be the shadow of some old tools. What looked like a giant was really some piled-up furniture. “Here it is!” said Papa. “My old night light! The one I used when I was a cub and had a little trouble falling asleep in the dark!” Sister couldn’t quite believe that her big, powerful papa was ever afraid of the dark.  “Oh, sure,” said Papa. “Most of us are at one time or another.” “How about reading the rest of The Case of the Crying Cave?” Sister asked Brother later that day. “Are you sure you want me to?” “Sure! I want to see how it turns out!” she insisted. When it turned out that there was nothing very spooky about the terrible wailing noise (it was caused by wind blowing across an opening in the roof of the cave—like the noise you make when you blow across the top of a bottle), Sister was a little disappointed. And that night, when she and Brother were all settled down in the cozy glow of Papa’s old night light, she said so. “I was pretty disappointed by the way The Case of the Crying Cave ended.” “Why?” asked Brother. “Because,” she said, “I was hoping the wailing would be a really spooky, scary monster!” And she leaned down from her bunk over Brother’s and made a spooky, scary monster face at him. “Cut that out!” cried Brother. Then Sister went right to sleep. But Brother lay awake for quite some time listening to the owl hoots and thinking that maybe he’d had enough mysteries for a while. "
"Most morning, in Bear Country, the sun rose to greet the day and the mockingbird sang its copycat songs outside an upstairs window of the bears’ tree house. And inside the tree house Brother Bear and Sister Bear would wake up. Brother and Sister usually got along very well. They took turns nicely with the bathroom. They said “please” and “thank you” at breakfast. They often sat together on the school bus. And after school they worked together happily on their special project—their own backyard tree house. But one gray morning Brother and Sister didn’t get along well at all! Maybe it was the weather—or maybe it was because the mockingbird slept late. But whatever it was, Brother and Sister Bear got into a big fight... Sister Bear opened her eyes and stretched. Then she sat up and let her legs dangle over the edge of her bed—right in Brother Bear’s face. She didn’t do it to be rude. It was just one of those things that happens with bunk beds. But that morning Brother was not in a very good mood. “Sister!” he shouted. “Get your dopey feet out of my face!” “My feet aren’t dopey, and they’re not in your face!” she shouted back. “Get your dopey face out of my face!” snarled Brother. “You shut up!” snapped Sister...and before Brother could answer, she skipped into the bathroom ahead of him. She took a very long time...brushing her teeth, washing up, and brushing her fur. “You’d better come out of that bathroom!” shouted Brother, banging on the door. “Brother Bear,” said Papa, coming out of his bedroom, “you know better than to shout at your sister.” “But she’s taking too long in the bathroom,” complained Brother, “and she’s doing it on purpose!” When Brother raised his fist to bang on the door again, it opened and out came Sister, all spruced up, “Good morning, Papa,” she said, as nice as you please. “Gr-r-r!” said Brother. Brother and Sister didn’t say “please” and “thank you” that morning at breakfast—because they weren’t speaking to each other. And they didn’t sit together on the school bus. Sister sat in the front and Brother sat way in the back. That afternoon they made a line down the middle of their backyard tree house to show which half was whose. It wasn’t much fun sitting up there in their tree house not speaking. Especially when it began to rain—hard! Later they kept on being mean by taking back the things they usually shared. Sister took back her modeling clay—which Brother had made into dinosaurs—and rolled it into one big lump. Brother took back his trucks and planes and put them on the top shelf where Sister couldn’t reach them. They got so angry that they forgot they weren’t speaking and began shouting at each other even louder than before. Then Papa lost his temper and began shouting at them to stop shouting. The neighbors didn’t know which was worse—the big storm of the racket coming from the bear’s house. Mama had quite enough. She put two fingers to her mouth and whistled—very very loudly. Papa and the cubs were so surprised that they stopped shouting. “I didn’t know you could whistle like that, Mama,” said Sister. “Well, I can. And I can also tell you,” said Mama sternly, “that I’ve had quite enough of this foolish fighting. Why, I doubt you two even remember what you’re fighting about!” The cubs tried to remember, but they couldn’t. Mama took the cubs into her lab. “Everybody gets into an argument once in a while,” she said. “Even folks who love each other very much.” “You and I don’t have arguments,” said Papa. “Oh, yes, we do,” said Mama. “No, we don’t,” argued Papa. “We’re having one right now,” said Mama, “about whether or not we have arguments!” While Papa thought that one over, Mama went on to say that occasional arguments are part of living together. “We get angry, even call each other names and say things we really don’t mean—and after a while it's over.” “Like the storm?” asked Sister. The rain had almost stopped, and the sun was beginning to shine through the clouds. “Yes,” said Mama. “Like the storm.” “Look!” said Papa. The sun shining on the last of the rain had made a rainbow. “A rainbow is something very beautiful that happens after a storm,” said Mama, looking at the cubs. “You mean like making up after a big fight?” “Sort of,” said Mama. So Brother and Sister Bear hugged and made up. And got along just beautifully—until the next time, anyway. "
"It was the last day of school and the beginning of vacation—that wonderful time when little bears could sit around doing absolutely nothing. Brother Bear and Sister Bear shouted good-bye to Teacher Jane and hopped onto the bus for the happy trip home. “Well?” asked Mama Bear after a day or so of vacation. “Are you enjoying sitting around doing nothing?” “It’s great!” said Sister. “Absolutely!” said Brother. “There’s just one trouble with it,” added Sister. “There’s nothing to do!” “Here’s take a look at this,” said Mama as she reached for something that had come in the mail. This is what it looked like: TIRED OF SITTING AROUND DOING NOTHING? COME TO GRIZZLY BOB”S DAY CAMP SUMMER FUN FOR CUBS OF ALL AGES SIMMING CANOEING ARTS & CRAFTS SPORTS & GAMES NATURE STUDY FULLY SUPERVISED BOB AND DON’T FORGET OUR EXCITING OVERNIGHT CAMPFIRE POWWOW AND SLEEP-OUT. Some of the things looked interesting. But Brother wondered what “fully supervised” meant. And Sister wasn’t so sure about that “overnight sleep-out.” It sounded a little scary. “Where is this camp?” asked Sister. “Not far,” answered Mama. “How will we get there?” Brother wanted to know. “A bus comes for you in the morning and brings you home in the afternoon.” “Sounds a little like school,” said Brother. “We’ll think about it,” said the cubs, and went back to doing nothing—well, not exactly nothing...They picked a few wildflowers, chased a few butterflies, turned over a few rocks... —and thought about it. “Mama, could we try Grizzly Bob’s Day Camp just to see if we like it?” they asked. “Of course,” said Mama. A couple of mornings later, Brother and Sister were in camp shorts and T-shirts, all ready and waiting when the bus came. It didn’t look much like the school bus. And Grizzly Bob didn’t look much like Teacher Jane. And the camp didn’t look anything like school! Grizzly Bob had built his camp beside a lake at the edge of the forest. There were log buildings, a flagpole flying the camp flag, a big bulletin board with the camp rules—there certainly were a lot of rules—some interesting paths, a roped-in place to swim... There was even a big red canoe! Bod had made name tags for the cubs. “You’re campmates now, so you better get to know each other,” he said. Then he took them on a tour of the camp. There was an office with a desk, where he did his paperwork, and first-aid corner full of bandages and things for cuts and bruises. There was a Rec Hall to go into when it rained. “Rec” was short for recreation. There was a picnic place and a barbecue pit where they roasted hot dogs for lunch. Sister burned hers a little, but she traded with another cub who liked burned hot dogs. Bob announced that after lunch they would all climb up Spook Hill to the very top of Skull Rock—the special place where they would have their end-of-camp powwow and sleep-out. It was quite a climb! That evening Mama and Papa Bear were eager to know how the cubs liked camp. “It was okay,” said Brother. “But they sure have a lot of rules!” “It was all right,” agreed Sister. “They sure have plenty of bandages and stingy stuff for cuts!” But what they were both thinking about was skull Rock and that end-of-camp sleep-out. Especially Sister. The second day was different. Brother had a great day. He passed the swimming test and was allowed to ride in the canoe. Sister didn’t have such a good day. She played dodge ball ad some of the cubs threw pretty hard. The third day Sister had fun. She got a star for a birch picture frame she made in arts and crafts. But Brother hurt his knee in the wheelbarrow race. The fourth day both of them had fun—And every day after that! So much fun that they forgot about Skull Rock and the sleep-out... —almost. Papa found the sleeping bags that he and Mama had used on their honeymoon, and when the camp bus came on the morning of the big night, Brother and Sister were ready...sort of. The climb up Spooky Hill wasn’t so hard this time—even with backpacks. The cubs were strong and tough from their summer of camping. Tomorrow would be Field Day—the last day of camp, when their parents would come to watch their games and contests and see awards given out. But, for now, all the cubs could think about was the big sleep-out. It was just beginning to get dark when they reached Skull Rock. Grizzly Bob built a campfire. Then he went into small cave. When he came out, he was dressed in a beautiful Indian costume! Then the cubs sat in a semicircle, and the powwow began. Bob told them old Indian legends of the great animal spirits—the story of the Great Grizzly as Big as a Mountain, the Soaring Eagle Who Filled the Sky, and the Mighty Salmon Whose Colors Made the Rainbow. As Bob told the old stories, the cubs could almost see the wonderful creatures in the firelit smoke as it curled up into the night sky. After the powwow, they had cocoa and honey bread. Then they curled up in their sleeping bags. And soon they were all fast asleep...even Sister. The next day Brother and Sister did very well in the Field Day games and contests. Brother won a trophy for finishing second in the dash, and Sister got medals for the dead-bear’s float and for her bead belt. It was almost the end of summer, school would be starting in a couple of weeks. “Well?” asked Papa. “How did you like camp?” “It was great!” said Brother, hugging his trophy. “It was great!” agreed Sister, wearing her medals proudly. “But you know something? After Grizzly Bob’s Day Camp, school will be like a vacation!” "
"It was a lazy sort of day in Bear Country. The air was so still that the leaves on the big tree house where the Bear family lived were hardly rustling. Except in the beehive, where the bees were always busy, nothing much seemed to be happening. It was the sort of day that somethings leads to mischief. Inside the tree house Brother and Sister Bear were sitting around not doing anything in particular. Brother was holding his soccer ball—he’d become interested in soccer and had been outside practicing free kicks. Sister was relaxing in an easy chair, thinking about what to do next. Neither Papa nor Mama Bear was around. Papa was in his shop working on some furniture, and Mama was out shopping. “I know what,” said Sister. “Let’s go gather some wild blackberries.” Brother thought about that. “No,” he said, “wild blackberries have too many thorns, and besides, the seeds get stuck in your teeth.” “Well, then,” said Sister, “let’s go out and twist each other up on the swing and see who gets the dizziest.” Brother thought about that. “No,” he said. “That’s silly, and besides, we did that yesterday.” Sister became irritated and impatient with her brother. “My goodness!” she complained. “You don’t want to do anything. All you want to do is sit there and hug that soccer ball. I think you must be in love with that soccer ball!” “I am not!” protested Brother. “But I’ll tell you something—I bet I can dribble this ball past you!” Brother was a pretty good soccer player and a very good dribbler. But so was Sister. The only one who saw what happened next, besides the cubs, was a mockingbird who was perched on a twig outside an open window. Brother faced Sister. The ball was on the floor between them. First Brother moved the ball with his right foot, then with his left, trying to trick Sister out of position. Then, quick as a flash, he gave the ball a sharp kick with his right. It almost worked. But Sister was fast too. She reached out with her knee and blocked the ball, which bounced against a bookshelf, against a chair, against a footstool, and into Mama’s most favorite lamp, which fell to the floor with a crash. The mockingbird let out a screech and got out of there as fast as its wings could carry it. As it flew away it saw Mama Bear returning from the marketplace! Now, the Bear family had some house rules just as any family has. One was “No honey eating in bed.” Another was “No tracking mud on the clean floors.” And another was “No ball playing in the house!” What to do? Brother looked at Sister. Sister looked at Brother. They both looked at the broken lamp. And they both listened in horror as Mama came up the front steps and into the house. All Brother had time to do before Mama came into the room was roll the ball behind Papa’s chair. “My lamp!” said Mama. “My best lamp! What happened?” she asked, looking into her cubs’ eyes. “Tell me about it.” The cubs looked into Mama’s eyes, then at each other, and then they began to tell one of the biggest whoppers that has ever been told in Bear Country. “It was a bird!” began Brother. “Yes,” added Sister, “a big purple bird with yellow feet!” “And green wing tips,” added Brother. “And funny-looking red feathers sticking out of its head,” said Sister, as a finishing touch. As most lies do, the purple bird whopper got bigger and bigger and bigger. “Yes,” continued the cubs, “and it flew in that window, zoomed around the room, and knocked over the lamp!” As Mama Bear was looking at the broken lamp with a sad expression on her face, Papa Bear came in from his shop. The cubs began to tell him the story of the big bird that flew in the window and broke the lamp. It was harder to tell the second time. For one thing, they couldn’t quite remember how they had told it the first time. “You’ve got me confused,” said Papa. “Was it a purple bird with green wing tips and yellow feet?” “Or a yellow bird with purple wing tips and green feet?” “Or...was it a white bird with black spots...like that soccer ball behind my easy chair?” But the thing that really made it hard the second time was how very sad Mama looked as she picked up the pieces of the broken lamp. “Mama, we’re really sorry about the lamp,” said Brother. “Oh, yes!” said Sister, picking up the last piece and putting it in the dust pan. “Oh,” said Mama, “I’m not worried about the lamp. We can always get another lamp, or we can glue this one back together. What I ‘m sad about is the thought that maybe, just maybe, my cubs, whom I’ve always trusted, aren’t telling me the truth. And trust is not something you can put back together again.” Both cubs started to talk at once. “It wasn’t a bird!” said Sister. “It was a soccer ball.” “And it was all my fault!” shouted Brother. “It was just as much my fault!” shouted Sister. But they were both shouted down by the phone, which rang loudly. It was Grizzly Gran inviting the Bear family for a Sunday visit. “Hello, Gran!” said Mama. “Oh, everything is just fine here in the tree house. How is everything with you?” “But, Mama!” protested Sister after Mama hung up the phone. “You told Gran that everything is fine here, and that isn’t really the truth.” “Oh, but it is,” answered Mama. “We’ve got two fine cubs who have just learned a very important lesson about telling the truth. And what could be finer than that? Now, let’s help Papa glue the lamp back together.” Nobody really expects cubs to be perfect, and from time to time Brother and Sister Bear did forget the rules. Brother ate honey in bed a couple of times. One time Sister tracked a little mud on the clean floor. And once or twice Brother and Sister started to play ball in the hose before they remembered not to. But they never, ever again told a whopper...because trust is one thing you can’t put back together once it’s broken.  "
"The Bear family, who lived in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in Bear Country, was a very happy family. One of the reasons was that they were all very busy. Each member of the family had work to do. Papa Bear cut and split logs and made the wood into handsome furniture which he was proud to sell. Mama Bear not only took care of her family, but she managed the whole tree house and tended the vegetable patch as well. And, of course, Brother and Sister Bear had important jobs too: going to school and keeping up with their schoolwork. The members of the Bear family had hobbies, too. Papa’s favorite hobbies were fishing and napping. He caught almost as many naps as he caught fish. Brother and Sister also had many hobbies. Brother was especially proud of his model airplanes. He liked to have Mama watch him fly his models, and sometimes she helped him fly his tether plane. Sister was a super rope-jumper and her goal was to jump a thousand times without a miss. She liked to have Mama count for her because Sister could jump faster than she could count. Since Mama was so busy with her household duties, she had time for just one hobby—but what a hobby! Mama was the best quilt maker in all of Bear Country! Her quilts were light and fluffy, but very warm. Her stitchery was fine and even. And her designs were original and exciting. Sister Bear slept cozy and warm under a quilt that showed her jumping rope. Brother went to sleep under a handsome airplane design. And the big quilt on Mama and Papa’s bed showed the Bear family’s beautiful tree house. Yes, the members of the Bear family had happy, busy, full lives. Especially Mama. “My dear,” called Papa to Mama as she worked in the vegetable patch, “if it wouldn’t be too much trouble, would you put aside any fishing worms you might find?” “Look, Mama!” called Brother. “I’m going to fly my new biplane!” “I’m going to try for a thousand, Mama!” said Sister. “Would you please count for me?” A little too full, thought Mama from time to time. She would have liked to have a little more time for her quilts. She had some lovely design ideas she wanted to try: a sunburst with clouds and bluebirds... a beautiful bouquet of flowers with butterflies... and a harvest scene with pumpkins and squash. But there just never seemed to be enough time. Then one day something happed that changed the lives of the Bear family—something that changed Mama’s quilt-making from a hobby... into a business! It might not have happened except for a coincidence, which is when two things happen at the same time. The two things that happened were that Papa had a big sale of some very special furniture, and on the same day Mama hung out the family quilts to air. Folks who came to buy Papa’s handsome furniture became excited about Mama’s beautiful quilts and wanted to buy them, too. Would-be buyers offered Mama quite a lot of money. They were very disappointed when she told them that the quilts were not for sale. “With your talent, you really should be in business!” they said. “Mama in business?” said Papa, patting her on the shoulder. “I don’t think so. One business-bear in the family is enough.” But Mama wasn’t so sure. She was proud of her quilt-making skills and knowledge. After all, she was president of the Bear Country Quilting Club. Other quilt makers often came to her for help and advice. That evening Papa and the cubs noticed that Mama was very quiet. She was quiet during supper. She was quiet during cleanup. She was quiet all evening. She was quiet because she was thinking—thinking about going into business. The next day at lunch she made her big announcement. “I’ve decided to open up a quilt shop.” she said, “and I’ve rented the empty store just down the road.” “Not that overgrown wreck that’s been empty for years!” protested Papa. “But you don’t want to be a business-bear,” said Sister. “you’re our mama!” “That’s no reason why I shouldn’t open my own quilt shop. A lot of mama bears have jobs: Mrs. Grizzle is a sister; Mrs. Honeybear teaches school; Dr. Gert grizzly is your pediatrician...” “Yeah,” said Brother, “but they’re not our mama!” “There’s really nothing to worry about,” said Mama. “Things aren’t going to be all that different.” “Will you still count for me when I jump rope?” asked Sister. “And will you still watch my fly my airplanes?” Brother wanted to know. “And how about my fishing worms?” asked Papa. “Will you still put them aside for me when you tend the vegetable patch?” “We’ll see about all that,” Mama said. “Meanwhile, I have to be at the shop. Some of my quilt club friends are helping me get it ready—and, oh yes,” she added as she turned to leave, “there’s a lot to do, so supper may be a little late tonight. Ta-ta!” “Ta-ta,” said Papa. “Ta-ta,” said the cubs. Supper wasn’t a little late that night. It was a lot late—and it was Papa and the cubs who prepared it. But they didn’t mind, because although Mama was very tired, she was very happy, too—happy and excited! “Guess what!” said Sister as she served Mama her supper. “I reached a thousand jumps today! Brother counted for me!” “And Sis helped me fly my tether plane! We had a great flight!” added Brother. “And I weeded the vegetable patch,” said Papa, bringing a tub of warm water to Mama for her tired feet. “Well,” said Mama. “I’m very proud of you all.” Papa and the cubs were very proud of her, too. There was no way to tell whether the quilt shop would be a success, but she certainly was giving it a good try. After about two weeks of hard work, the Bear Country Quilt Shop had its grand opening. It was a very exciting event! Not only did Mama sell her own quilts, but she sold quilts for all the members of her club as well. It was a great success. Why, even Mayor and Mrs. Honeypot came in their long lavender limousine. They bought one quilt and ordered three more. “I know what!” said Mama as she closed up shop that night. “Let’s stop off at the Burger Bear for supper! My treat!” The Bear family celebrated with a delicious Burger Bear supper. Papa and the cubs were very proud of their business-bear wife and mama. The extra money came in handy too! "
"Brother and Sister Bear, who lived with their mama and papa in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road dee in Bear Country, looked quite a lot alike. Except for the fact that Brother was a boy cub and Sister was a girl cub, they were alike in many ways. And even though they each had hobbies (Brother loved to build and fly model airplanes; Sister had all sorts of special interests), they enjoyed many of the same things: bike riding, baseball, soccer, Frisbee, and just getting out and enjoying nature. Yes, Brother and Sister were alike in many ways. But in some important ways they were different. Brother Bear was cautious and careful and a little wary of strangers, Sister, on the other hand, wasn’t the least bit wary. She was friendly to a fault. Just about everybody that came her way got a big hello. “Hello, butterfly!” “Hello, frog!” “Hello, Mr. Truck Driver!” “Hello, Mrs. Shopper!” Brother worried about Sister’s free and easy way with strangers. Strangers weren’t a problem for him. Not talking to strangers suited cautious and careful Brother just fine. But friendly-to-a-fault Sister was different. She talked to everybody. “Sister,” said Brother. “You’re going to have to stop that!” “Stop what?” she asked. “Talking to strangers! It’s just not a good idea!” “Why?” she wanted to know. “Why shouldn’t I talk to strangers? What harm is there in it? Is there something wrong with strangers?” “Hmm,” said Brother, thinking about it for a moment. “Those aren’t questions for a brother. Those are for a mama or papa...” “Sister Bear, I’m glad you asked those questions!” said Papa Bear, in his deepest and most serious voice. “The reason you should never talk to a stranger and never ever take presents from a stranger and never ever ever go anywhere with a stranger is that it’s dangerous.” “What’s dangerous about it?” she asked, wide-eyed. “What can happen?” “Oh, dear,” thought Mama Bear. “I do hope Papa can tell Sister about strangers without making everything scary.” “All sorts of thinks!” Papa said. “Here! Look at the newspaper!” As she looked at it her eyes got wider and wider. This is what she saw... “I hope you’re paying attention to all this,” called Papa to Brother Bear. “Yes, Papa,” said Brother looking up from his airplanes. When Sister asked for a bedtime story that evening, Papa said, “Of course! I have just the one!” It was in an old book that Papa had kept since he was a cub. The story was called “Silly Goose and Wily Fox.” It told how Silly Goose got into a conversation with Wily Fox, and before Silly knew quite what was happening she found herself in Wily’s lair. This is how the story ended. “’...then there was a snip and a snap and all that was left of Silly Goose was a few floating feathers and a smile on the face of Wily Fox.’” Sister had a hard time falling asleep that night. Her mind was filled with those headlines. There was even one that SILLY GOOSE MISSING! WILY FOX QUESTIONED! The sound of Brother Bear’s peaceful breathing finally lulled her to sleep. The next day dawned bright and friendly—to everybody but Sister. She had spent a restless night and when she looked out the window, everything seemed a little strange. The trees seemed to reach for her, an owl stared at her, and the crows glared. “Let’s go out and ride our bikes on the village green!” said Brother after breakfast. But Sister didn’t want to. Brother was puzzled. The green was a bright, busy, friendly place where she loved to play. “Well, how about some soccer?” But she didn’t want to do that either. It wasn’t until he suggested Frisbee, her favorite game, that she agreed to go along. Before they left, they told Mama where they’d be—it was a family rule that they never went anywhere without telling Mama or Papa. “That’s fine,” said Mama. “I’m on my way to Farmer Ben’s for apples. I’ll stop by for you on the way home.” The village green was the same bustling place it had always been. This is what it looked like—to everyone but Sister. This is what it looked like to her. Today even the frogs and butterflies seemed mean and scary to Sister. Later, when somebody tapped her on the shoulder, she jumped a mile—even though it was just Mama. “How was everything at the village green?” asked Mama on the way home in the car. Sister sat in front with Mama, and Brother rode in back with the barrel of apples. “All right, I guess,” said Sister. “But there were so many strangers!” Later at home, when Mama and Sister were getting ready to make applesauce, Mama said, “You know, what Papa told you was quite right. it’s not a good idea to talk to strangers or accept presents or rides from them.” “But,” she continued, “that doesn’t mean that all strangers are bad. Why, chances are, there wasn’t a single person on that green that would harm a fly, much less a fine little cub like you. The trouble is...well, it’s like this barrel of apples. There’s an old saying that goes, ‘There’ll always be a couple of bad apples in every barrel.’ This the way it is with strangers. Cubs have to be careful because of the few bad apples.’” “Look! said Sister. “I found one! It’s all bumpy and has a funny shape!” “Well, it certainly is strange looking,” said Mama. “But that doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad. You can’t always tell from the outside which are the ‘bad apples.’” She cut it in half. “See?” she said. “It’s fine inside.” “Now here’s one that looks fine on the outside... —but inside, it’s all wormy.” “Yugh!” said Sister. “What’s up?” asked Brother. “A bad apple!” said Sister. “Double yugh!” said Brother. “Hey! I’m going to the meadow to fly my new pusher plane. Want to come?” “Sure,” Sister said. “I can pick some wildflowers!” She felt much better now—more like her old friendly self. The pusher plane was a great success, and the cubs were about to head home when someone drove onto the meadow with a big beautiful orange and green model airplane. “Wait!” said Brother. “I want to watch! It’s a radio-controlled job!” Sister went back to picking wildflowers, but before she knew it, Brother was talking to the stranger! For that’s what he was, a stranger—no matter how big and beautiful his radio-controlled job was! She dropped her wildflowers and ran over to them. “I’m going to send it up and follow in the car,” the stranger was saying. “Want to come along?” “Wow! said Brother. And he would have—if Sister hadn’t grabbed his arm and said, “Don’t you dare!” The stranger drove off following his airplane, and Sister ran home shouting. “Brother talked to a stranger! Brother talked to a stranger!” “But it was a big orange and green radio-controlled job! said Brother. “That doesn’t matter,” said Papa. “We have rules about strangers—and they’re important!” “We have rules about tattletales, too,” said Brother, glaring at Sister. “Sister wasn’t tattling. Tattling is telling just to be mean,” explained Mama. “And Sister was telling because she loves you and was worried.” “Do you think that fellow was a ‘bad apple’?” asked Brother. “Probably not,” said Mama. “That’s right,” said Sister. “Most folks are friendly and nice and wouldn’t hurt a fly. But you have to be careful, just in case.” “Speaking of apples,” said Mama, “how about some of this applesauce I just made?” As they sat having a dish of Mama’s delicious applesauce, Brother and Sister thought about what they had learned that day. There was quite a lot to think about. For Brother and Sister’s Rules for Cubs, turn the page. BROTHER AND SISTER BEAR’S RULES FOR CUBS 1. Never talk to a stranger. 2. Never take candy or other gifts from a stranger. 3. Never ever go anywhere with a stranger. 4. Don’t keep secrets from your parents—especially if someone asks you to. 5. Your body is your own personal property and nobody else’s business—especially the private parts. (When you’re real little, of course, mama or Papa may help you with your bath or in the bathroom—and your doctor is in the body business and will have to examine you from time to time, even when you’re not little.) 6. Use your common sense. We can’t have rules for everything. Common sense is what keeps us safe by telling us what to do in situations that are not covered by rules."
"There was trouble in the big tree house down a sunny dirt road deep in Bear Country—trouble with manners. The Bear family’s trouble with manners was that they forgot them! At first it was just an occasional “please” or “thank you” that was forgotten. Then there was a rude push without an “excuse me.” Then a reach across the table instead of a “please pass the broccoli.” Mama Bear wasn’t quite sure how or why it happened. But she was sure of one thing—whatever the reason, the Bear family had become a pushing, shoving, name-calling, ill-mannered mess! At the table it was even worse. They were a grabbing, mouth-stuffing, food-fighting, kicking-under-the-table super mess! Of course, Mama Bear tried to correct Brother and Sister Bear’s behavior. She tried coaxing. She tried complaining. She tried shouting! She tried going to Papa for help (though it sometimes seemed to Mama that he was part of the problem). Papa banged on the table and shouted as only he could shout. But nothing really seemed to do any good. Mama didn’t like what was happening to her family. Not one bit. Something had to be done. But what? The best way to fight bad habits, she thought, was with good habits. Then she thought of a plan. She got a big piece of cardboard and a marker. At the top she wrote: THE BEAR FAMILY POLITENESS PLAN When the plan was finished, she called a family meeting and showed it to Papa and the cubs. It certainly got the Bear family’s attention! Mama’s plan had a list of all the rude things she wanted to stop. Beside each one was a penalty—a job or chore that went with it. If you forgot a “please” or a “thank you,” you had to sweep the front steps. If you pushed or shoved, you had to beat two rugs. If you got caught name calling, you had to clean the whole cellar! “But, Mama!” sputtered the cubs. “You’re not being fair!” “It seems to me,” she said, “that you’re the ones who aren’t being fair—to yourselves or anyone else. That’s what manners are all about—being fair and considerate. Manners are very important. They help us get along with each other. Why, without manners—” “Your mama’s absolutely right!” interrupted Papa. “Thank you, Papa, for your comment. But interrupting is number three on Rude List, and the penalty is dusting the downstairs.” Mama said, and handed him the feather duster. “Hmm,” said Brother. “This looks serious. I think we’d better come up with a plan of our own or we’re going to be doing a lot of extra chores.” “What sort of plan?” asked Sister. “Well,” he said, “instead of just being polite, we’ll be super polite. We’ll ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ so much that Mama will get fed up and call the whole thing off!” “Yes,” said Sister. “We’ll be so polite, she won’t be able to stand it!” They put their plan into action. They were super polite... —on the stairs: “After you, Sister dear!” “Thank you, dear Brother!” —in the hall: “Excuse me, Brother dear!” “Why, certainly, my dear Sister!” —waiting for the bathroom: “Terribly sorry to have kept you waiting!” “Think nothing of it, my dear!” But it didn’t work the way they expected. Mama didn’t get fed up at all. And after a while Brother and Sister forgot about being super polite and were just polite... —at the table: “Pass the honey, please.” “Certainly.” —in their room: “Would you like me to help you pick up your toys?” “Thank you very much.” —in the yard: “Oops! Sorry—I didn’t mean to bump you.” “That’s all right. No harm done.” And it turned out that Mama had been right: thinks did go more smoothly. Once they got into the good manners habit, they didn’t even have to think about it. But it wasn’t so easy for Papa. He was the one who got fed up. It’s a little harder to change habits when you’re older, and he had to do quite a few extra chores for forgetting his manners. “I’m glad to get out of the house, away from that Politeness Plan!” he said as he drove the family along the highway on a trip to the supermarket. “Manners and courtesy are just as important away from home—especially on the road,” said Mama as they stopped at a stop sign to let pedestrians and other cars pass. “They help us drive safely.” “Well,” grumbled Papa as they all went into the busy supermarket, “I think you can have too much of a good thing—you’ve got to have common sense along with manners!! Why if you let everyone go ahead of you at the checkout, you’d be there forever! “And sometimes you have to interrupt—Excuse me, madam,” he interrupted a shopper, “but I believe you have a leaking bottle in your cart!” The shopper thanked him for his help. “You see?” he said, driving home. “There’s more to life than remembering your manners. Besides, manners are all right for cubs and mama bears...” “...but we papa bears have other things to think about—” At that moment the car in front stopped suddenly and Papa bumped into it. He was furious. “Why, that pinheaded fiddlebrain!” he snarled. “Name calling!” reminded Sister. The penalty for name calling was cleaning the whole cellar, so Papa gritted his teeth and remembered his manners. And a good thing, too. Because climbing out of the other car was the biggest, angriest bear he had ever seen. But when the angry bear saw how polite Papa was, he remembered his manners too. He explained that he had stopped short because a mama duck and her ducklings had crossed in front of him. Then he and Papa Bear looked at their bumpers and saw that no harm had been done. “As I was saying,” said Papa as they continued on their way, “it’s very important for us to remember our manners at all times—and I want to thank you, Sister, for reminding me to remember mine.” “You’re very welcome, I’m sure,” said Sister Bear politely.
